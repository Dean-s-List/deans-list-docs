## Emissary Public Draft by Ahm3d

Public Draft on rules of the Game, open for discussion on every Dean's List DAO Call.

### Requirements to Submit Interest

* Be a citizen.
* Pay an application fee of 50,000 $DEAN to the Realms Treasury.
* Submit your interest detailing why you are the perfect candidate for the grant & your plans on how you will represent our Network State at Breakpoint. 
* All applications to be received by 1 to 2 weeks of the intended event.

*[Note: Operationally, we will put out a set of questions in a dedicated public channel for candidates to refer to when submitting their interest]*

### Canvassing

* This will be followed by a two week period for canvassing by the applicants for support. It is expected that candidates will not engage in any activity that is unbecoming of a citizen. For abundant clarity, & with utmost respect to my fellow citizens, inducements are not allowed. Candidates may, however, record a video, write a message or host calls to take questions. It is also perfectly fine for them to not canvas support & just let their visibility in the day to day tasks they do be their advertisement. 

### Voting

* Voting will be done via the multiple choice UI.
* The candidate with 60% quorum or with the most votes will be declared the winner.

Candidates may vote in their own favor - there is the chance that this may be unfair to those with less $DEAN holdings which is why the requirement for a runoff and a quorum is being put in. 

### Disbursals

* The winning candidate will have to produce a valid visa & evidence of having obtained a ticket to the event or a confirmation that they have been invited as a speaker. 
* On being satisfied, the main Squads will disburse 50% of the grant amount to the winning candidate. 
* The remaining 50% of the grant shall be disbursed on touch down in 'x' location for the event itself. A tweet with a picture of the candidate at any landmark in 'x' location would be enough.

### Deliverables

* Representation of the Dean's List Network State & championing our cause at every opportunity. 
* Using the platform to network extensively & build relationships-
* Extend invitations to our Network State to fellow citizens who maybe interested in purchasing a service, joining as members or partnering with us-
* Within 7 days of returning home, producing a short document summarizing the activities that the candidate engaged in and key takeaways. The candidate may host a call alternatively as well. 
* Following up on leads / relationships established. 

### Force Majeure

* If for any reason, the candidate is unable to travel, he will be required to reimburse the disbursed value of the grant back to the DAO failing which the DAO reserves the right to set off the unrecovered sum against any unpaid / future payouts to the concerned member.
* In case of such an eventuality, where the winning candidate expresses his inability to proceed with making the trip & returns any sums advanced or fails to produce a valid visa plus his/her Breakpoint ticket / invitation in the first place, the DAO may award the grant to the runner up via a ratification vote. In case such a vote does not pass, the grant will be deemed to have been forfeited.
