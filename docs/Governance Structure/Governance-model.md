Here are key aspects of the governance structure of Dean's List Dao:

* **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)**: Dean's List DAO operates as a DAO, leveraging decentralized governance principles. This implies that decision-making is distributed among its members rather than being concentrated in a central authority.

* **Proposal Mechanism**: The governance model likely includes a mechanism for members to propose initiatives, changes, or decisions within the DAO. This could involve submitting proposals through a designated platform or forum.

* **Voting Mechanism**: To reach consensus on proposed actions or decisions, a voting mechanism is likely in place. Members may use governance tokens to cast votes on proposals, ensuring a democratic and decentralized decision-making process.

* **Token-Based Governance**: Governance tokens are likely used not only for voting but also as a means to represent ownership or membership within the DAO. Holding these tokens may grant members certain rights or privileges in the decision-making process.

* **Regular Community Engagement**: The governance model may encourage regular community engagement, discussions, and feedback sessions to maintain an active and informed community. This aligns with the belief in the importance of daily discussions for community growth.

* **Quorum Requirements**: The reference to quorum in the provided information suggests that a minimum level of participation or agreement may be required for certain decisions or votes to be considered valid.
