title: Proposals Drafting
---

The primary objective of our DAO is to foster refinements and enhancements for any product or service through ideas and feedback. In our community, an idea serves as a proposal that can be suggested by any of our citizens. The process of crafting proposals in Dean's List DAO involves several key steps:

1. **Ideation and Drafting**:

* Community-Driven: Ideas for proposals can emerge from any member of the Dean's List DAO community. This emphasizes a bottom-up, community-driven approach where innovation and suggestions come organically from the members.

* Discussions: The initial phase often takes place in community spaces such as Discord channels or the DAO's forum. Members engage in discussions, share their ideas, and explore potential solutions.

2. **Formalizing the Proposal**:

* Drafting: When an idea gains attraction and community support, a member can take the initiative to formalize it into a proposal. This involves drafting a comprehensive document that clearly articulates the problem the proposal addresses, the proposed solution, expected outcomes, and any resource requirements.

* Clarity and Detail: The proposal aims for clarity and detail, providing sufficient information for other members to understand the proposal's intent and implications fully.

3. **Submitting to Realms**:

* Proposal Portal: The formalized proposal is then submitted to the Realms platform. Realms serves as the central hub for governance activities within Dean's List DAO, acting as the main portal for proposal submission and decision-making.

* Accessibility: The platform ensures accessibility for all DAO citizens, enabling them to review and participate in the governance process.

4. **Discussion and Refinement**:

* Open Review: Once on Realms, the proposal becomes open for review and discussion by all DAO citizens. Transparency is a key principle, allowing members to actively participate in the decision-making process.

* Feedback and Edits: Members engage in discussions, provide constructive feedback, suggest edits, and raise potential concerns. This phase serves as a collaborative effort to refine and strengthen the proposal before it moves further in the governance pipeline.

This iterative process, encompassing ideation, drafting, submission, and open discussion, ensures that proposals undergo thorough vetting, benefit from diverse perspectives, and align with the collective vision of the Dean's List DAO community. It exemplifies a democratic and participatory governance model within the DAO ecosystem. Following the finalization of the proposal, we proceed to the voting mechanism of the structure.
