## Governance Model & Voting Mechanisms

At the moment, governance in the DAO can be exercised by a Council called the “Signer” & “Realms Council Token Holder” via Squads and Realms or the Community “One Of Us” via Realms  — a reference to their role on the main DAO treasuries on Squads.

Regarding the Council these 5 individuals are the most active members of the community and are subject to a challenge process where any member of the community can offer themselves as a replacement giving reasons in support of their candidacy.

The system works efficiently but is only an interlude of sorts on our way to true token governance — a decentralized community making decisions together not just in terms of choosing their elected representatives but for each and everything that concerns the DAO.

That being said Dean's List DAO uses a Multi-sig Voting for their Council and for the Community uses a token-Based Quorum Voting.
