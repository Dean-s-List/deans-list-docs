Dean's List is a Service DAO consisting of Web3 power users who provide valuable feedback sessions, as well as a variety of other services and consultation to projects wishing to succeed in the space, or simply seeking to refine their products for an overall better UX.

Consider our community an ecosystem of feedback bounty opportunities. Dean’s List is hired by clients for a rigorous feedback session, in which participants are paid USDC and $DEAN for work contributed. Participants in feedback receive payouts correlative to points accumulated by making comments on our Feedback Dashboard.

Dean's List started as a subDAO from Grape Protocol in 2022 as Grape served as foundation to find core power users on the Solana blockchain which the core focus would be providing feedback sessions to new and upcoming protocols on the Solana ecosystem.

Throughout 2023 Dean's List reinforced their workforce by inviting new power users to the DAO and worked they way through multiple feedback sessions with new and already reputable protocols.

As of now, **Dean's List DAO** has expanded into multiple areas such as:

* Feedback Sessions
* Discord Support
* Grants
* Case Studies
* Tokenomics Reviews
* Projects Launchpad

### How It Works

Dean’s List is made up of a flat hierarchy of roles to be fulfilled by delegated citizens.  Each task, managerial or otherwise, constitutes a budget proposal which must be executed on by the DAO. This means all allocated initiatives are visible to DAO members, who are encouraged to seek to fulfill those roles, as well as discuss proposals of their own. 

New users join via purchasing a [Business Visa](https://visa.deanslist.services/) or a [Dean’s List](https://www.tensor.trade/trade/deanslist) token, both of which are NFTs that gate access to opportunities within the DAO. We have Recruitment initiatives in place to incentivize the growth of our Network State, the processes of which are flexible to accommodate our growth, but are clearly documented, maintained, and available to Recruits, Recruiters, and any interested parties.
