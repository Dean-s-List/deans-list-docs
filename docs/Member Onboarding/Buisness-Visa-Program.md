Welcome to the Dean's List DAO Business Visa Program â€“ an exclusive opportunity to immerse yourself in our digital network state, explore earning opportunities in USDC, and experience firsthand the collaborative and innovative environment we've cultivated.

The Business Visa is a 30-day membership granting you access to specific benefits and insights into the workings of Dean's List DAO. It's designed for individuals curious about our vision, interested in exploring our decentralized service economy, and eager to contribute their skills and talents.

### Why Join the Business Visa Program?

* **Immerse yourself in the Network State** : Gain valuable firsthand experience of how our DAO operates, participates in governance, and delivers services.

* **Explore USDC earning opportunities** : Access specific channels and initiatives within the DAO that offer the potential to earn USDC (USD Coin), a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. This allows you to experience the economic potential of our network state.

* **Evaluate your fit** : Assess if Dean's List DAO aligns with your values, interests, and aspirations for collaborative work in a decentralized environment.

* **Contribute your skills** : Even as a Business Visa holder, you can still contribute your skills and talents to specific projects and initiatives within the DAO, making a valuable impact during your 30-day trial period.

### What's Included in the Business Visa?

* **Limited access to USDC earning opportunities** : Participate in select initiatives and channels within the DAO that offer potential USDC rewards, allowing you to experience the economic aspects of the network state.

* **Access to designated DAO channels**: Engage with other members in specific channels dedicated to Business Visa holders, fostering communication and collaboration within this trial group.

* **Participation in non-binding discussions and polls**: Although voting rights are reserved for full citizens, Business Visa holders can still voice their opinions and participate in non-binding discussions and polls, contributing to the overall community discourse.

* **Exposure to the DAO's governance framework**: Observe how Dean's List DAO makes decisions, operates its multi-layered governance structure (Realms, Squads, Council of the People), and fosters collaboration among its members.

### What Happens After 30 Days?

At the end of your 30-day Business Visa period, you have several options:

* **Renew your Business Visa**: If you want to continue experiencing the DAO and exploring USDC earning opportunities, you can renew your Visa for a monthly fee.

* **Become a Full Citizen**: For deeper engagement, voting rights, and full access to the DAO's functionalities, consider becoming a Full Citizen by purchasing our **NFT (Non-Fungible Token)**. This grants you a permanent membership within the network state.

* **Choose not to continue**: If the Business Visa doesn't align with your goals, you can simply choose not to renew and explore other opportunities.
