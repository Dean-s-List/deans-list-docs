## Talent Scouting

Citizens with the `@One_Of_Us Role` in the Main Dean’s List Discord server are encouraged to seek power users from other Web3 communities and beyond, by inviting them to our [Onboarding Server](https://discord.gg/bqz7YqpNvY), and directing them to where to find available work.


When you find a qualified and interested individual:
- **1)** Stake 5,000 $DEAN in their name
- **2)** Put up $5 for their 60 day BV 
	(BV is $5 per month, and the first month is free!)

**When they earn $250, you’ll get your $DEAN back, and you both get $25!**

- Send to **1** and **2** `7A6CrNWAFFBpQTBRo5fULibqqB3MouNLgbVBf8D3MJAx`
- Share transaction signatures in [#Onboarding channel](https://discord.com/channels/953959331353751632/1182593796677054475) 

*Please the following format:*

```
**RECRUITMENT IN PROGRESS**
by @[recruiter_discord_username]
@[recruit_discord_username] / screenname
proof of deposits:
DEAN- 
UDSC-
```
- Add your Recruit to the [Dean’s List Recruit Log](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eDKbDXB1D0_jvfCF8EmT-3cA2gS_55DF-qwib41X1lk/edit?usp=sharing)  
- Provide your Recruit the [Dean’s List BV Orientation Doc](/docs/Onboarding/Orientation)  

We’ve currently got **$1000** in the pool, enough for 20 onboard kickbacks: **First come first serve**, kickbacks will be awarded the order in which they are achieved!

### Guide Your Recruit to Available Work

All feedback must be conducted in the [DL Onboarding Server](https://discord.gg/bqz7YqpNvY) or [DL Dashboard](https://dash.deanslist.services/). Ensure you’ve set up your Reviewer Profile, and instruct your Recruit to do so as well. Available work will be visible on your Dashboard.

We’re making a lot of exciting changes, and we don’t want you to get mixed up. In order to maximize your overall engagement, and thus your earnings, it’s vital you share your concerns or questions! Ping a Manager in the [#Onboarding channel](https://discord.com/channels/953959331353751632/1182593796677054475) 

If at any point you are not sure what steps to take for Recruitment, Feedback, Governance or otherwise, ping a manager and we’ll get to you as quickly as we can. Thanks for taking the extra initiative to help expand our community of Web3 power users!
