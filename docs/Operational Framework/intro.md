The operational framework of a DAO refers to the set of processes, strategies, and tools that define how the DAO functions on a day-to-day basis. It encompasses various aspects, including governance, decision-making, community engagement, and feedback mechanisms. Here is an outline of the operational framework for Dean's List DAO:

## Operational Framework

### Governance and Decision-Making

- **Proposal Lifecycle:** The DAO follows a structured proposal lifecycle, from ideation and drafting to submission, discussion, voting, and execution.

### Feedback Loop

- **Community-Driven Feedback:** The DAO encourages community members to actively provide feedback on proposals, projects, and overall DAO activities.
- **Iterative Ideation:** Ideas and proposals go through an iterative process of ideation, drafting, submission, and open discussion to ensure thorough vetting and refinement.

### Community Engagement

- **Discord Channels:** Real-time communication and engagement happen on Discord channels, providing a space for discussions, announcements, and community interactions.
- **Forums:** Asynchronous collaboration takes place on forums, allowing for in-depth discussions, proposal drafting, and community engagement beyond real-time conversations.

- **Open Feedback Channels:** Regularly seek feedback from the community to identify areas for improvement and innovation in the DAO's operational processes.

The operational framework of Dean's List DAO is designed to foster transparent governance, active community engagement, and a continuous feedback loop, ensuring the DAO's effective functioning and growth within the Web3 ecosystem.
