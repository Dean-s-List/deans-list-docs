The Dean's List DAO is a pioneering Digital Network State on the Solana blockchain, transitioning from a Service DAO to shape the future of decentralized collaboration. Positioned as the first "Service DAO" on Solana, it aims to provide prosperity and opportunities for its citizens by creating on-chain value through service-oriented products. Fueled by a clear vision and leveraging governance protocols and DAO tooling, the DAO unites contributors globally, fostering trust in a borderless community. With a focus on monetizing feedback as a service, the Dean's List DAO not only adds value to projects but sets a template for other digital network states. In essence, it's a dynamic community-driven organization, propelling the evolution of decentralized work and collaboration in the Web3 space.

Dean's List Dao offer several products for users:

* **Citizenship Model for the Community**: The Dean's List DAO citizenship model involves a one-time membership fee, granting access to the DAO's ecosystem and services. It emphasizes contributor incentives, transparent token distribution, and real-world initiatives like workshops and embassy expansions to bridge the transition from a digital to a physical network state.

* **GDP-Driven Services**: The DAO focuses on creating on-chain value through service-oriented products, contributing to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the Digital Network State.

* **Monetized Feedback Services**: The DAO provides a unique offering by monetizing feedback as a service, recognizing the value it brings to projects and ensuring fair compensation for citizens providing feedback.

* **Buisness Visa Program**: The best way to get a feel of our Network State is to apply for a Business Visa which allows users/members 30 days of access to certain USDC earning opportunities as well as a glimpse into how we operate. On the expiration of the 30 day grace period, users may choose to renew for a monthly fee or, better yet, become a full citizen by purchasing our NFT.

* **$DEAN Token**: Introducing a native governance token, $DEAN, which is utilized within the DAO's ecosystem for voting, decision-making, and incentivizing active participation.

* **Dean NFT**: Our NFT is the highest and only proof of citizenship and grants you full access to all aspects of our Network State. Keeping with Dunbar's number, the collection is limited to 100 members only.  

* **Embassies and Global Outreach**: The DAO plans to expand its physical presence by establishing embassies, initially running workshops worldwide to educate and onboard new citizens while marketing its services to Web2 businesses.
